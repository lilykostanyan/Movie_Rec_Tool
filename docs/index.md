## ðŸ§  Overview

This project presents a content-based movie recommendation system that combines semantic search with genre filtering to deliver relevant and engaging movie suggestions. Users can interact through a web interface powered by Streamlit and backed by FastAPI, Elasticsearch, and Google BigQuery.

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

To recommend movies based on:
- A user-provided description or preference
- Genre-based filtering (strict or relaxed)
- An optional conversational AI assistant powered by Gemini API

---

## ðŸ§© Key Features

- **Hybrid Retrieval:** Combines semantic similarity (SBERT embeddings) with BM25 ranking.
- **Interactive UI:** Streamlit app lets users select genres, adjust filters, and input free-text queries.
- **Two Modes of Recommendation:**
  - Our Model (SBERT + BM25)
  - Gemini AI (chatbot-style experience)
- **Visual Results:** Includes movie posters, actors, ratings, and summaries.
- **Scalable Infrastructure:** All components containerized using Docker.

---

## ðŸ”§ Architecture

- **ETL Service:** Loads vectorized `.json` movie synopses into Elasticsearch.
- **Backend:** FastAPI app that performs semantic search and data enrichment from BigQuery.
- **Frontend:** Streamlit UI for user interaction and displaying recommendations.
- **Elasticsearch:** Stores embeddings and handles similarity search.
- **Kibana:** Offers visual inspection of indexed data.
