# - Backend (FastAPI)

The **FastAPI backend** service is responsible for handling user requests, running recommendation logic, and returning enriched movie suggestions.

---

## - Features

- **/recommend_movies** (POST):  
  Accepts a movie description and genre filters, and returns personalized movie suggestions.

- **/ (root)** (GET):  
  A health check route confirming the API is live.

## - Recommendation Flow

1. **User Input**: Accepts a query and genre selection.
2. **SBERT Encoding**: Converts the query to an embedding using a SentenceTransformer.
3. **Hybrid Search**: Combines cosine similarity and BM25 search in Elasticsearch.
4. **Genre Filtering**: Filters results by genre using strict or relaxed mode.
5. **Metadata Enrichment**: Fetches detailed metadata (title, poster, rating, actors) from BigQuery.
6. **Response**: Returns a structured list of top movie matches.

## - Dependencies

All environment-driven configurations are stored in `.env` and accessed through the `config.py` module.

- **Elasticsearch** setup and credentials
- **BigQuery** service account and table info
- **SBERT model** for semantic search
- **Genre options** and filtering mode
